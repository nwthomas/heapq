# heapq 🥞

A TypeScript implementation of the Python heapq module.

To be honest, I just got tired of not having a great heap module in the JavaScript standard library, and all of the ones on npm haven't been touched in the better part of a decade.

## Installation

You can install `heapq` quickly.

With [Bun](https://bun.com):

```bash
bun install @nwthomas/heapq
```

With [npm](https://nodejs.org):

```bash
npm install @nwthomas/heapq
```

With [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
yarn install @nwthomas/heapq
```

With [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm install @nwthomas/heapq
```

## Setup

For development setup, make sure to first setup bun. Setups can be found here:

```bash
https://bun.com
```

Next, install all dependencies:

```bash
bun install # or bun i
```

TODO - Finish
